# Svelte TODO lists

This project was created using svelte & typescript and create-svelte-app(CSA). It allows users to create multiple lists of todos and manage each list. The todos data is store into localStorage.
For styling I have used W3.css. The purpose of this project is just to be able to use the most common apis svelte.

### Up next:

For the next itteration of this project I'am considering to use firebase and allow users to aunthenticate to retrive their data. I might also migrate the project to use SvelteKit and Tailwind, but it's just a consideration. Stay tunned on my page and check what it will come next.
